# Piping and Redirection in Linux

Piping (`|`) and redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `<<`) are fundamental concepts in Linux and Unix-like operating systems. They allow users to efficiently manipulate and manage the flow of data between commands, files, and processes. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective command-line usage.

# Piping (|)

Piping, denoted by the `|` symbol, enables you to take the output of one command and use it as the input for another command. This feature allows you to chain commands together to create more powerful and complex workflows.

For example, to list files in a directory and then search for specific files within that list:

```bash
ls | grep "pattern"
```
#### You can also chain multiple commands together using pipes:
```bash
ls | grep -i "bash" | wc -l
```

# Redirection

Redirection involves sending command output to a file or taking a file's content as input for a command.

## Redirecting to a New File

To redirect the output of a command to a new file, use the > operator. For instance:
```bash
ls -lhrt > redirection.txt
```

This will create a new file called redirection.txt and store the output of the ls command in it.

## Redirecting to an Existing File

To redirect output to an existing file and replace its contents, use the > operator. However, if you want to append the output to the existing file, use the >> operator. Example:

```bash
cat 123.txt
```
```bash
ls -lhrt > 123.txt
```
```bash
ls -lhrt >> 123.txt
```
## Redirecting From an Existing File

You can also redirect input from an existing file to a command. Here's an example using grep to search for "123" in the content of 123.txt:

```bash
grep -i "123" < 123.txt
```
## Redirecting STDERR


To redirect only error messages (STDERR) to a file, use 2> before the > operator. Example:

```bash
ls nofile.txt 2> error.txt
```
If you want to capture both standard output (STDOUT) and STDERR in a single file, you can use the following syntax:

```bash
ls nofile.txt bash > error.txt 2>&1
```
These commands help streamline operations and manage command output effectively in Linux.
