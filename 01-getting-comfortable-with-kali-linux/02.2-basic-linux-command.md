## basic linux commands

### mkdir command

1. mkdir command in Linux allows the user to create directories. This command can create multiple directories at once as well as set the permissions for the directories. 

### syntax :

```bash
mkdir [options...] [directories ...]
```
#### Some practical examples of the mkdir command are shown below. 

- for single directory
```bash
mkdir first
```
- for multiple directories
```bash
mkdir first second third
```
### rm command

2. rm stands for remove here. rm command is used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links and so on.  rm removes references to objects from the filesystem, where those objects might have had multiple references for example, a file with two different names. This command normally works silently and you should be very careful while running rm command because once you delete the files then you are not able to recove it.

### syntax :

```bash
rm [OPTION]... FILE...
```
#### Some practical examples of the rm command are shown below. 
```bash
 ls
a.txt  b.txt  c.txt  d.txt  e.txt
```
- Removing one file at a time
```bash
rm a.txt
```
```bash
ls
b.txt  c.txt  d.txt  e.txt
```
- Removing more than one file at a time
```bash
rm b.txt c.txt
```
```bash
ls
d.txt  e.txt
```
### cp command

3. cp stands for a copy. This command is used to copy files or groups of files or directories. It creates an exact image of a file on a disk with a different file name.

### syntax :

```bash
cp [OPTION] Source Destination
cp [OPTION] Source Directory
cp [OPTION] Source-1 Source-2 Source-3 Source-n Directory
```
#### Some practical examples of the cp command are shown below.
- there is a directory named 'mydir' having a text file a.txt
```bash
ls
a.txt
```
```bash
cp a.txt b.txt
```
```bash
ls
a.txt  b.txt
```
- there is a directory named 'mydir' having a text file a.txt, b.txt and a directory name 'newdir' in which we are going to copy all files. 

```bash
ls
a.txt  b.txt  newdir
```
- create a new directory 'newdir'
```bash
ls newdir
```
```bash
cp a.txt b.txt newdir
```
```bash
ls newdir
a.txt  b.txt
```
