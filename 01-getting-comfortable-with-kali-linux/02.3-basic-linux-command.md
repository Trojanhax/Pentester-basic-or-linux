## basic linux commands

### mv command

1. mv command moves files and directories from one directory to another or renames a file or directory. If you move a file or directory to a new directory, it retains the base file name. When you move a file, all links to other files remain intact, except when you move it to a different file system.

### syntax :

```bash
mv [options(s)] [source_file_name(s)] [Destination_file_name]
```
- source_file_name(s) = The name of the files that we want to rename or move.
- Destination_file_name = The name of the new location or the name of the file.

#### Some practical examples of the mv command are shown below.
- Moving single files in Linux 
```bash
mv myfile /home/kali/xyz/
```
- Moving Multiple files in Linux 
```bash
mv myfile myfile3 myfile2 /home/kali/xyz/
```
- Renaming a directory in Linux
```bash
mv myfile newfile
```
### cat command
2. Cat(concatenate) command is very frequently used in Linux. It reads data from the file and gives its content as output. It helps us to create, view, and concatenate file.

### syntax:

```bash
cat file_name
```
#### Some practical examples of the cat command are shown below.
- To view single files
```bash
cat h.txt
```
- To view multiple files
```bash
cat h.txt i.txt
```
### cat command
3. grep filter searches a file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. The pattern that is searched in the file is referred to as the regular expression .
### syntax:
```bash
grep [options] pattern [files]
```
```bash
Options Description
-c : This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
-h : Display the matched lines, but do not display the filenames.
-i : Ignores, case for matching
-l : Displays list of a filenames only.
-n : Display the matched lines and their line numbers.
-v : This prints out all the lines that do not matches the pattern
-e exp : Specifies expression with this option. Can use multiple times.
-f file : Takes patterns from file, one per line.
-E : Treats pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE)
-w : Match whole word
-o : Print only the matched parts of a matching line,
 with each such part on a separate output line.

-A n : Prints searched line and nlines after the result.
-B n : Prints searched line and n line before the result.
-C n : Prints searched line and n lines after before the result.
```
#### Some practical examples of the grep command are shown below.
- Consider the below file as an input. 

```bash
cat myfile.txt
```
- output of an file
```bash
Linux is a popular operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It has many distributions which have different interfaces for installing software, different user interfaces, and so on. One thing all of the 'distros' have in common is that they all have a command line interface, or terminal
```
- Case insensitive search : The -i option enables to search for a string case insensitively in the given file.
```bash
grep -i "liNUx" myfile.txt
```
- Displaying the count of number of matches : We can find the number of lines that matches the given string/pattern
```bash
grep -c "liNUx" myfile.txt
```
-  Checking for the whole words in a file : By default, grep matches the given string/pattern even if it is found as a substring in a file. The -w option to grep makes it match only the whole words.
```bash
grep -w "liNUx" myfile.txt
```
- Displaying only the matched pattern : By default, grep displays the entire line which has the matched string. We can make the grep to display only the matched string by using the -o option. 
```bash
grep -o "liNUx" myfile.txt
```
- Show line number while displaying the output using grep -n : To show the line number of file with the line matched. 
```bash
grep -n "liNUx" myfile.txt
```
- Display the file names that matches the pattern : We can just display the files that contains the given string/pattern.
```bash
grep -l "liNUx" myfile.txt

or

grep -l "liNUx" myfile.txt f1.txt f2.txt f3.xt f4.txt
```
