- **Access Command:** To list files: `ls /bin`

## 3. **/boot (Boot Files)**

- **Purpose:** Contains files necessary for the Linux kernel to boot the system.
- **Access Command:** To list files: `ls /boot`

## 4. **/dev (Device Files)**

- **Purpose:** Contains special device files representing hardware devices.
- **Access Command:** To list files: `ls /dev`

## 5. **/etc (Configuration Files)**

- **Purpose:** Stores system-wide configuration files and directories.
- **Access Command:** To list files: `ls /etc`

## 6. **/home (User Home Directories)**

- **Purpose:** Contains home directories for regular users.
- **Access Command:** To list user home directories: `ls /home`

## 7. **/lib (Library Files)**

## 8. **/media (Removable Media)**

- **Purpose:** Mount points for removable media like USB drives and CD/DVD-ROMs.
- **Access Command:** To list mounted media: `ls /media`

## 9. **/mnt (Mount Points)**

- **Purpose:** Temporary mount points for manually mounted file systems.
- **Access Command:** To list mounted file systems: `ls /mnt`

## 10. **/opt (Optional Software)**

- **Purpose:** Directory for optional software packages installed by administrators.
- **Access Command:** To list files: `ls /opt`

## 11. **/proc (Process Information)**

- **Purpose:** A virtual file system containing information about running processes and system configuration.

## 12. **/root (Root User Home)**

- **Purpose:** The home directory for the root user (system administrator).
- **Access Command:** To list files: `ls /root`

## 13. **/run (Runtime Data)**

- **Purpose:** Stores runtime data files, such as process IDs, during system operation.
- **Access Command:** To list files: `ls /run`

## 14. **/sbin (System Binaries)**

- **Purpose:** Contains essential system binaries and administrative commands.
