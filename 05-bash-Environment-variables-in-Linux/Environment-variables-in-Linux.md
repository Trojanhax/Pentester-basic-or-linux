# Environment variables in Linux 
## Environment variables
Environment variables in Linux are named values that store information used by the operating system and various applications. They provide a way to configure and customize the behavior of the system and user environment. 

### Here are some common environment variables in Linux along with examples of how they are used:

1. `PATH`: This variable specifies a list of directories where the shell looks for executable files when you type a command. It's used to find and execute programs without specifying their full paths.

Example:

```bash
echo $PATH
```
2. HOME: The HOME variable points to the current user's home directory, which is the default location for user-specific files and configurations.

Example:
```bash
echo $HOME
```
3. USER: It stores the username of the currently logged-in user.

Example:
```bash
echo $USER
```
4. LANG: This variable defines the default language and character encoding for the system.

Example:
```bash
echo $LANG
```
5. SHELL: It specifies the default shell for the user.

Example:
```bash
echo $SHELL
```
6. TERM: The TERM variable specifies the type of terminal emulator in use, affecting terminal behavior and appearance.

Example:
```bash
echo $TERM
```
7. DISPLAY: This variable defines the X Window System display server to use for graphical applications.

Example:
```bash
echo $DISPLAY
```
8. LD_LIBRARY_PATH: It lists directories where the dynamic linker/loader should look for shared libraries required by executable files.

Example:
```bash
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
9. PS1: The PS1 variable controls the appearance of the shell prompt and allows users to customize it.

Example:
```bash
echo $PS1
```
10. HISTFILE and HISTSIZE: These variables are related to command history. HISTFILE specifies the file where command history is stored, and HISTSIZE sets the maximum number of history entries to retain.

Example:
```bash
echo $HISTFILE
echo $HISTSIZE
```
# How to access ENVs linux ?
In Linux, you can access environment variables using various methods and commands depending on your specific use case. Here are some common ways to access environment variables:

- Using the echo Command: You can use the echo command followed by the variable's name preceded by a dollar sign to display its value in the terminal. For example, to access the PATH environment variable:
```bash
echo $PATH
```
# Setting Environment Variables in Linux
Environment variables in Linux are used to store configuration information and are accessible to various applications and processes. You can set environment variables for your current session, a specific user, or system-wide.

## For the Current Session (Temporary)
To set environment variables temporarily for your current shell session, use the export command:

```bash
export VARIABLE_NAME="variable_value"
```
Example:
```bash
export MY_VARIABLE="Hello, World!"
```
These variables will be available only for the duration of the session and won't persist after you log out.

## For a Specific User (Persistent)
To set environment variables for a specific user and make them persistent across sessions, modify the user's shell configuration files:

1. Open the user's shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.profile) using a text editor:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```
2. Add the environment variable assignment at the end of the file:
```bash
export MY_VARIABLE="Hello, World!"
```
Save the file, and the variable will be available each time the user logs in.

## System-Wide (Persistent)

To set environment variables system-wide, modify system-level configuration files. The /etc/environment file is commonly used:

1. Open /etc/environment with a text editor and add your environment variable:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/environment
```
2. Add your variable in the format VARIABLE_NAME="variable_value":
```bash
MY_VARIABLE="Hello, World!"
```
Save the file, and the variable will be available to all users and persist across reboots.

## Using Shell Startup Scripts (Advanced)

For advanced customization, you can create or modify shell startup scripts like /etc/profile, /etc/profile.d/, or /etc/bash.bashrc depending on your distribution. These scripts are executed when users log in and can set environment variables globally.

For example, to set a system-wide environment variable, create a script in /etc/profile.d/:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/myenvvars.sh
```
Add your environment variable assignment:
```bash
export MY_VARIABLE="Hello, World!"
```
Save the file, and this variable will be available to all users.

After setting environment variables, log out and log back in or restart your system for the changes to take effect. Use the echo command to verify that your environment variable has been set correctly:
```bash
echo $MY_VARIABLE
```
It should display the value you assigned to the variable.
