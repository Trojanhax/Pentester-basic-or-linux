# The `grep` Command in Unix/Linux

The `grep` command is a powerful text-searching utility in Unix/Linux systems. It allows you to search for patterns or specific text within files, directories, or the output of other commands. `grep` is especially useful for text processing, log analysis, and system administration tasks.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the `grep` command is as follows:

```bash
grep [options] pattern [file(s)]
```
- -options: Various command-line options that modify the behavior of grep. Common options include -i (case-insensitive), -r (recursive search), -l (list only file names), -v (invert match), and more.

- pattern: The regular expression or plain text string you want to search for within the specified file(s) or input.

- file(s): Optional. You can specify one or more file names or use wildcards (*) to search within multiple files. If you omit this part, grep will search the standard input (e.g., data piped into it).

```
Options Description
-c : This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
-h : Display the matched lines, but do not display the filenames.
-i : Ignores, case for matching
-l : Displays list of a filenames only.
-n : Display the matched lines and their line numbers.
-v : This prints out all the lines that do not matches the pattern
-e exp : Specifies expression with this option. Can use multiple times.
-f file : Takes patterns from file, one per line.
-E : Treats pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE)
-w : Match whole word
-o : Print only the matched parts of a matching line,
 with each such part on a separate output line.

-A n : Prints searched line and nlines after the result.
-B n : Prints searched line and n line before the result.
-C n : Prints searched line and n lines after before the result.
```

# Common Use Cases

## 1. Search for a String in a File:

To search for a specific string in a file, use:
```BASH
grep "pattern" filename
```
For example, to search for the word "example" in a file called sample.txt, you can use:
```BASH
grep "example" sample.txt
```
## 2. Case-Insensitive Search:

To perform a case-insensitive search, use the -i option:
```BASH
grep -i "pattern" filename
```
For example:
```
grep -i "LINUX" ABC.txt
```
## 3. Search for a Pattern in Multiple Files:

You can search for a pattern in multiple files by providing a list of file names or using wildcards. For instance, to search for "pattern" in all .txt files in the current directory:
```BASH
grep "pattern" *.txt
```
## 4. Recursive Search in Directories:

To search for a pattern recursively in all files within a directory and its subdirectories, use the -r option:
```BASH
grep -r "pattern" directory_name
```
## 5. Count Matching Lines:

To count the number of lines containing the pattern (without displaying the lines), use the -c option:

```BASH
grep -c "pattern" filename
```
## 6. Print Lines That Don't Match:

To invert the match and print lines that do not contain the pattern, use the -v option:
```BASH
grep -v "pattern" filename
```
## 7. Display Matching Line Numbers:

To show line numbers along with matching lines, use the -n option:
```BASH
grep -n "pattern" filename
```
