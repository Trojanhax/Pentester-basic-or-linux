# Sed Command in Linux

The sed (stream editor) command in Unix/Linux is a powerful text-processing utility for filtering and transforming text. It allows you to perform a wide range of operations on text streams, such as editing, substituting, deleting, and more.

## 1. Substitution (s command):

The s command is used to substitute (replace) text in a file or stream.

```bash
# Replace "old" with "new" in a file
sed 's/old/new/' input.txt
```
## 2. In-Place Editing (-i option):

You can perform in-place editing of a file by using the -i option. This edits the file directly without creating a backup.
```bash
# Replace "old" with "new" in a file in-place
sed -i 's/old/new/' input.txt
```
## 3. Using Regular Expressions:

sed supports regular expressions for more complex pattern matching.
```bash
# Replace all occurrences of numbers with "NUM"
echo "1234 5678" | sed 's/[0-9]\+/NUM/g'
```

## 4. Print Specific Lines (p command):

You can print specific lines that match a pattern using the p command.





```bash
# Print lines containing "pattern"
sed -n '/pattern/p' input.txt
```
## 5. Delete Lines (d command):

The d command deletes lines that match a pattern.


```bash
# Delete lines containing "pattern"
sed '/pattern/d' input.txt
```
## 6. Print Line Numbers (= command):

You can print line numbers for matching lines using the = command.
```bash
# Print line numbers for lines containing "pattern"
sed -n '/pattern/=' input.txt
```

## 7. Print Range of Lines (n command):

The n command allows you to print a range of lines.
```bash
# Print lines 2 to 4
sed -n '2,4p' input.txt
```
## 8. Append Text (a command):

The a command appends text after a specified line.
```bash
# Append "new line" after lines containing "pattern"
sed '/pattern/a new line' input.txt
```
## 9. Insert Text (i command):

The i command inserts text before a specified line
```bash
# Insert "new line" before lines containing "pattern"
sed '/pattern/i new line' input.txt
```
## 10. Print Only Matched Text (s///p):

You can use the p flag with the substitution command to print only the lines that were modified.
```bash
# Print lines with "old" and replace "old" with "new"
sed -n 's/old/new/p' input.txt
```
## 11. Delete Empty Lines:

You can use sed to delete empty lines in a file.
```bash
# Delete empty lines
sed '/^$/d' input.txt
```
