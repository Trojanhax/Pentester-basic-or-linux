#  awk Command in Linux

The awk command in Linux/Unix is a versatile text-processing tool that is used for processing and manipulating structured text data, such as columns or fields of data separated by delimiters (e.g., spaces, tabs, or commas). awk is particularly useful for tasks like data extraction, reporting, and transformation. Here are some common awk commands with examples:

## 1. Print Specific Columns:

awk can be used to print specific columns or fields from a file. By default, awk treats whitespace as the field separator.


```bash
# Print the second column of a file
awk '{print $2}' input.txt
```

## 2. Specify a Custom Field Separator:

You can specify a custom field separator using the -F option.

```bash
# Print the third column using a comma as the field separator
awk -F ',' '{print $3}' input.csv
```

## 3. Conditional Printing:

awk allows you to print lines that meet specific conditions.
```bash
# Print lines where the second column is greater than 50
awk '$2 > 50' input.txt
```
## 4. Calculate and Print the Sum of a Column:

You can use awk to calculate and print the sum of a column.
```bash
# Calculate and print the sum of the second column
awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}' input.txt
```
## 5. Count the Number of Lines:

You can count the number of lines in a file using awk.

```bash
# Count the number of lines in a file
awk 'END {print NR}' input.txt
```
## 6. Print Unique Values:

You can print unique values from a column using awk and sort.

```bash
# Print unique values from the first column
awk '{print $1}' input.txt | sort | uniq
```

## 7. Execute a Command on Each Line:

You can execute a command on each line of a file using awk.

```bash
# Execute the "echo" command on each line
awk '{system("echo " $0)}' input.txt
```
## 8. Print Rows Based on a Pattern:

You can print rows that match a specific pattern or condition.

```bash
# Print lines containing the word "pattern"
awk '/pattern/' input.txt
```
## 9. Print Range of Lines:

You can print a range of lines from a file.
```bash
# Print lines from 3 to 7
awk 'NR>=3 && NR<=7' input.txt
```
## 10. Process Files Using a Loop:

awk can process multiple files using a loop.

```bash
# Process multiple files and print the first column of each
awk '{print FILENAME, $1}' file1.txt file2.txt
```
## 11. Use AWK Scripts:

You can write more complex awk scripts in separate files and execute them.
```bash
# Create an AWK script in a file (myscript.awk)
# { if ($2 > 50) print $1, $2 }

# Execute the script on a file
awk -f myscript.awk input.txt
```
