# Sed Command in Linux

The sed command (short for stream editor) is a powerful text manipulation tool in Unix/Linux systems. It allows you to perform text transformations on an input stream (a file or data piped from another command) and produce an output stream. sed uses simple and powerful scripting capabilities for editing text. 

##  Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the sed command is as follows:

```bash
sed [options] 'script' input_file
```
- options: These are various command-line options that modify the behavior of sed. Common options include -e (for specifying a script inline), -i (to edit files in-place), and more.

- script: The sed script contains a sequence of commands enclosed in single quotes. Each command specifies an action to be performed on the input.

- input_file: The file or input stream to be processed by sed.

# Common sed Commands and Examples

Here are some common sed commands with examples:

## 1. Substitute (Search and Replace):
The s command is used to search for a pattern and replace it with another pattern.
```bash
# Syntax: s/pattern/replacement/
echo "Hello, World" | sed 's/World/Universe/'
```
Output:
```bash
Hello, Universe
```
## 2. Delete Lines:
The d command is used to delete lines that match a pattern.
```bash
# Delete lines containing "example"
echo -e "line 1\nexample line\nline 2" | sed '/example/d'
```
Output:
```bash
line 1
line 2
```
## 3. Print Specific Lines:
You can use the -n option to suppress automatic printing and then explicitly print lines using the p command.
```bash
# Print lines matching "pattern"
echo -e "apple\nbanana\ncherry" | sed -n '/banana/p'
```
Output:
```bash
banana
```
## 4. Replace Only the First Occurrence:
Use the s command with the g flag to replace only the first occurrence on each line.
```bash
# Replace only the first "apple" with "orange" on each line
echo -e "apple banana apple" | sed 's/apple/orange/'
```
Output:
```bash
orange banana apple
```
## 5. Replace All Occurrences:
Use the s command with the g flag to replace all occurrences on each line.
```bash
# Replace all "apple" with "orange" on each line
echo -e "apple banana apple" | sed 's/apple/orange/g'
```
Output:
```bash
orange banana orange
```
## 6. Insert a Line Before Matching Pattern:
The i command is used to insert a line before lines matching a pattern.

```bash
# Insert "New Line" before lines containing "pattern"
echo -e "line 1\npattern line\nline 2" | sed '/pattern/i New Line'
```
Output:
```bash
line 1
 New Line
pattern line
line 2
```
## 7. Append a Line After Matching Pattern:
The a command is used to append a line after lines matching a pattern.
```bash
# Append "Additional Line" after lines containing "pattern"
echo -e "line 1\npattern line\nline 2" | sed '/pattern/a Additional Line'
```
Output:
```bash
line 1
pattern line
 Additional Line
line 2
```
## 8. Edit Files In-Place:
Use the -i option to edit files in-place.
```bash
# Replace "apple" with "orange" in a file called "fruits.txt"
sed -i 's/apple/orange/' fruits.txt
```
